## Overview
GeoPPI is a deep learning based framework that uses deep geometric representations of protein complexes to model the effects of mutations on the binding affinity. To achieve both the powerful expressive capacity for geometric structures and the robustness of prediction, GeoPPI sequentially employs two components, namely a geometric encoder (excelling in extracting graphical features) and a gradient-boosting tree (GBT, excelling in avoiding overfitting). The geometric encoder is a graph neural network that performs neural message passing on the neighboring atoms for updating representations of the center atom. It is trained via a novel self-supervised learning scheme to produce deep geometric representations for protein structures. Based on these learned representations of both a complex and its mutant, the GBT learns from the mutation data to predict the corresponding binding affinity change.

Thanks to the above design, GeoPPI enjoys accurate predictive power, strong generalizability, and high inference speed for the estimation of the mutation impact.

## Installation

This source code is tested with `Python 3.8` on`Ubuntu 20.04`.  Users need to accomplish the following three steps to complete the installation.

### Step 1: Clone the GitHub repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Liuxg16/GeoPPI.git
cd GeoPPI
```

### Step 2: Build the required dependencies
Building the required dependencies requires runing the script:
```bash
sh install.sh [flag]
```
If your system has installed Anaconda software, please set [flag] to 1, otherwise set [flag] to 0. 

The above script will complete the following two things: 1) building a virtual enviroment named "ppi"; 2) installing required dependencies.  If you meet any difficulty during this installation, please refer to the full documentation (i.e., `GeoPPI documentation.pdf`) for more details.

### Step 3: Download FoldX

The FoldX Suite is available through academic and commercial licenses. Please apply for a license and download FoldX v4.0 binary file from: http://foldxsuite.crg.eu/

Once you download the FoldX file, please unzip the file and put the FoldX binary file in this main directory (i.e., GeoPPI/foldx). For example, suppose the file name is "foldxLinux64.tar.gz", run the following commands (ubuntu environment):
```bash
cp foldxLinux64.tar.gz GeoPPI/
tar -zxvf ./foldxLinux64.tar.gz
chmod  a+x ./foldx
```
Congratulations! The environment is ready to run GeoPPI. 

## Quick Example
Users can use GeoPPI to compute the binding affinity changes given the complex and the mutation information.

Before using GeoPPI, please activate the environment first.

```bash
conda activate ppi
```
Then, you can use the following command to obtain the results:
```bash
python run.py [pdb file] [Mutation] [partnerA_partnerB]
```
where [pdb file] is the complex structure of interest, [Mutation] denotes the mutation information and [partnerA_partnerB] describes the two interaction partners in the protein complex.

**Format of [Mutation]**: The mutation information includes WT residue, chain, residue index and mutant residue. such as “TI38F”, which stands for mutating the 38th acid amino at the I chain (i.e., phenylalanine) to threonine.

**Format of [partnerA_partnerB]**: [partnerA_partnerB] are the chains of the two parts of the binding. For example, if the H chain and the A chain of the complex belong to different proteins and interact with each other in the complex, [partnerA_partnerB] is “A_H”. Similarly, “HL_WV” stands for the H and L chains interact with the W and V chains.


**Program output**: After several seconds of computing, the GeoPPI program will return the impact of the input mutation, i.e.,

</p>

Thererfore, the positive value stands for the higher binding affinity between two proteins, i.e., the stabilizing mutation.

For example, when we execute the command:
```bash
python run.py data/testExamples/1PPF.pdb  TI17F  E_I
```

The program output is similar to the following:

```bash
========================================Results============================================
The predicted binding affinity change (wildtype-mutant) is -1.76 kcal/mol (destabilizing mutation).
```

### More examples
In the GeoPPI/data directory, there are several example complexes for users to test GeoPPI. Here, we also provide some example commands as follows.
```bash
python run.py data/testExamples/1PPF.pdb  TI17R  E_I
python run.py data/testExamples/1CZ8.pdb  KW84A  WV_HL
python run.py data/testExamples/1CSE.pdb  LI38I  E_I
python run.py data/testExamples/3SGB.pdb  KI7L  E_I
python run.py data/testExamples/3BT1.pdb  PU149A  U_A
```
## Running on your own structure
Users can also use their own structures to analyze the mutation effects by putting the PDB files into the directory data/testExamples/ and executing the above command again:
```bash
python run.py [pdb file] [Mutation] [partnerA_partnerB]
```
## Reproduce the SSCV experiment
In our work, we adopted a new cross-validation setting where the structures of complexes used in the training and testing are different. We used the ECOD (Evolutionary Classification of Domains) homology level to divide the data points to make different folds share no protein domain. We denote this new cross-validation experiment as the split-by-structure cross-validation (SSCV) to avoid confusion.

To reproduce the SSCV experiment on the S645 dataset, run the following command:
```bash
python sscv.py  data/S645/
```
After 30 minutes, you will get the prediction performance of GeoPPI (i.e., RP=0.51).
